If you enjoy using my script let me know, or if you have feed back send that too.

Purpose: Ever had so many scripts you couldn't manage them, or wanted an easy way to share scripts with workmates or across workstations,
Script Manager can help. The idea is to have a window to show all your scripts neatly arranged for easy access. There is a description/instruction field
so you can remind yourself what the requirements of a script may be, and you can add and delete your own categories and categorize all your scripts.
It also allows you to assign scripts to multiple categories, and this is completely free of any kind of database.

Usage: Put ml_scriptManager in your maya script folder (The one that gets autoloaded from the MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH, commonly set to documents/maya/maya version/scripts.
type ml_scriptManager in the command line or script editor, or alternatively create a text file in your script folder called userSetup.mel, and put ml_scriptManager in it to have
Script Manager load everytime you run Maya.

IMPORTANT: scriptManager runs best with scripts that have their main proc the same name as the script itself, i.e global proc test(){} in test.mel, this way you can just click the run button,
otherwise you can click the source button, (provided it has no procs required to run, or it calls its own proc itself). 

Notes: In the locations tab you can automatically load scripts in your favorite script editor, it defaults to Notepad++ but you can change the application in the Settings menu in ScriptManager.
You can also auto search Creative Crash for scripts from the Scripts tabs, it will launch your default browser with your search terms.
A right click menu has been added to the main list, select a script, right click to perform functions or assign to a category.

Feature List:

- Add as many local/network locations as you would like to load scripts from, share with others/multiple workstations
- Categorize your scripts within Script Manager. Right click menu for easier sorting.
